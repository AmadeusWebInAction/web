As Author of 2025's AmadeusWeb v7 (v1 was begun in 2019 from my 2 decades experience building file navigators and players among other things), I, Imran Ali Namazi assert:

* the right to be recognized as author and web architect of this and derived client work.
* the right to expect fair remuneration for all projects that use it.
* the right to decline work that doesn't fully match with my vision of thing.
* that all software exercises dont always work out to everyone's expectations - but its good to air these out.
* that said proprietary system will not be used without my involvement, without prior written assent and without platform and development fees paid.
* that adoption of growth model will be discussed candidly (again, this is a trial of our abilities to work together for a brighter future).
* that a renewal fee of $75 be charged per domain, per year, unless waived by me.
