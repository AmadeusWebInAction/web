In spirit, we adhere to [the terms](https://amadeusweb.com/start/terms-for-technology/) of the "[AmadeusWebCore](https://github.com/AmadeusWebInAction/core)".

Just as **All Amadeus Sites** and it's **Core Libraries** are made "Source Available" though proprietary, we too will make the public contents of our website available in this Git repository, binding visitors / viewers of the code, NOT to use unfairly or use the Core unfairly to build other websites without having a written agreement with AW Founder Imran.

There is a way to keep material for logged in users / internal employees and team members in a "private" repository and still be used in the website - we understand that it is our reponsibility to know the difference, and that we will not make the public site "private," and that we run the same risk of being "used without permission/intimation" as the Framework.

Furthermore, in matters of "ideas" and "content", we agree to [the spirit of things here](https://amadeusweb.com/start/terms-for-ideas-and-content/).
