## Ownership

The platform is and will remain proprietary, with due credit to its used libraries, contributors and those who brainstorm features and help with adoption.

We are trying to build it as a "team" but in actuality it, like every other team will rest on it's founder's hands, ON TRUST - like a "truth store". For most, this will be a proprietorship, in Imran's case, it will be just him as an individual - but involved in multiple teams, including the one that should grow around AmadeusWeb and AamadeusWebWorld itself.
