## It's History

For [long](#2012-rmi-framework), we have [pondered](#ym-2021) what's a good way to share money in a team. If teams can be close-knit and it's founder / founding team can set a cap for it's growth, allowing it's members to start other teams, great.

Close-knit because, no matter how much software people believe in offering "digital transformation" solutions to organizations, what really matters is [our humanity](https://imran.yieldmore.org/keep-smiling/) which keeps the "world-family" connected.

Yes, the day of "conscious consumerism" will dawn on this world, and so will fairness and equality.
