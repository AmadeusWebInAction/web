**Dear Potential Collaborator / Team Member / Client,**

## Introduction

* We are a team led by Imran - whose [career and IT skillsets are detailed here](https://imran.yieldmore.org/career-past/).
* He has been building file based cms websites since 2011 when he converted a static html site built in 2005.
* Was developing and writing for multiple wordpress websites which, in 2019, became a plugin / content sync / configuration/ security concern.
* He decided to hand-craft his own [framework, architected](http://amadeusweb.com) from the ground up in 2019, calling it **AmadeusWeb** after the classical composer.

## About the Platform

It's super simple, easy to extend and comes with many features like:

*   Content is mostly markdown with support for html too. Will provide a typography page when the training phase starts.
*   Powerful 3 (even 4) level menu.
*   Rich Pages (per selected theme)
*   Sheet Based Rendering (instead of database tables)
*   Content and sheet oriented site,
*   Videos and Albums can be embedded via a sheet.
*   Emails or whatsapp messages can quickly be created by ticking what the user wants and hitting send.Â 
*   Link back and forth to social media.
*   Modules like:
    *   Web chat (to an agent)
    *   Google analytics integration and sharer link generation
    *   Custom responsive banner / image
    *   Html decks that can be created via markdown / slides.com
    *   Assistant that provides a table of contents and a text to voice option.
    *   Sitemap (module / scaffoldable)
    *   Linking updates to and from social media
*   Full Website Backup and History via bitbucket.org (since code, assets, content and data are all simply files in the site).
*   Previewing changes at a subdomain before going live
*   File based cms and git means easy to sync across mine and content authors machine.
*   Have simplified the live update process via ftp sync tool which only deploys the delta after preview/live site has been tested in local machine.
*   Documentation and training material I can expand on.
* The platform, though source available, is proprietary.

## Addons & Development

*   A new theme - 5k for conversion including a simple sheet based approach for developing content of the home page.
    *   If not a free design or not from [canvastemplate.com], you will have to purchase
*   A progressive web app will be a minimum of 6k, exact amount to be determined once we understand the scope.
*   Any front end engineering will be either in Aurelia / Web Components, not Angular, Vue or React.

## In case of Moving Apart

If you decide to not continue, you will still have all the content in your:

*   Bitbucket repository
*   Google drive (sheets)
*   Emails / WhatsApp chat history (from members)
*   Chatra Account
*   Google Analytics

However Amadeus is proprietary and cannot be used without paying for it's annual platform fee. Self hosting we will take up on a case by case basis.

## Timelines

*   Call to discuss the requirements (preferably recorded by you on zoom) - 5k for this to be paid before we begin.
    * For requirements gathering and task management, suggest we use a Google Drive folder, maybe also todo.ly as a shared account. Have found these the simplest.
*   3 working days to prepare a task planning - suggest we use Google drive for all this.
*   If approved, 15k as advance.
*   Available on video call for 6 hours a week for training on content loading, till go live.
*   3 weeks for
    *   Setting up the website, menu and folder structure and handing over to your team for content development.
    *   Developing all features / sheet driven work, forms, rich pages, integrating images as banners for sections etc
*   1 week for finalising, reviewing and handing over. Will wait for balance payment before actually going live.
*   Final domain only needed at point of go live.
*   Post Live charges as mentioned will apply.

## In Conclusion

After 25 years of dedicated web and windows development, Imran is convinced more than ever that "no db", "no dedicated server" is ONE way forward. Architecturally as radical as it gets, we go into detail on the "reasons" section of the more menu.

#### Dislaimers

* Code is provided as-is and the majority of framework changes simply "go live".
* If you are worried about breaking changes (yes, this sometimes happens), we can discuss the creation of a "sanity check" / a "smoke test document" which will be tested by us beforehand each time a "**release**" is being made / point your preview url to a "amadeus-stable" environment and promote "amadeus-latest" as per the requirement priority.
* In the '90s, it used to be "**dll**" hell, and we still have version hell - so amadeus is unique in that it can support 100s of websites with just 1 copy of the framework - always "**-latest**". If you would rather run a stable self hosted solution, we can negotiate that, but that would mean paying for framework upgrades and dev time ensuring it goes smooth.
