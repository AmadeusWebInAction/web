> Imran has a lot of experience since the 2006 days when, as fresher, he undertook many many UI tasks - converting design images into the language of websites viz. html/css - so he is very fluent in this.

What this means is - any design / design element (theme / typography item) can be coded or tweaked - it is only a matter of time and effort - or, in the case of large UI requirements from customer, we may need to find a UX/UI engineer.
