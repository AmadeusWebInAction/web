## Programs for Children.

**Early 2021 / 2022**

Imran dropped into my centre for children early 2021 with several ideas to "change the world" - he still tries to do so and I'm glad of the progress he has made as an individual.

Seeing his enthusiasm and passion, I let him interact with a student right then and found him able to reach out and support the student to write his "first poem".

He exuded a "higher order thinking" and he soon evolved "ARYA" - Awareness Resulting in Your Action, a call by our youth to change themselves and ask us elders to care for one and all.

Those sessions were shortlived as the 2 adolescents I let him interact with were lagging behind on several fronts.

But, his optimism was buoyant as always and he got back to me a few months later with a "music led discussion" program that we tried first online, then through one of our teachers.

We conducted this and were happy with the outcome - happy enough, that when it concluded I asked him if he had any follow on ideas.

He did, what he called "creative expression" a way of building on the rapport the 8 student group had just gotten and inspiring them with more content to write articles.

This was an emotional time for him because the long and deep rooted desire to share his writing with children was coming true - especially when he shared [keep-smiling](https://imran.yieldmore.org/keep-smiling/)

Again, we were happy with the outcome. Later that year, he went on to articulate his [ideas for 7 programs](https://ideas.yieldmore.org/wisdom/programmes/) now waiting for the right audience and time.

## As a "web developer"

I also saw potential in him as a web developer in 2021 when we built an online course in then Amadeus 2.0. Somehow the market for it wasn't ready and we had to shelve it. But the summary material he developed with his team still stands ready.

Late 2021, he helped bring my ideas to a state of readiness in what became my current main business. We worked closely together over several weeks and I could see his creative thinking process add value to the content we were working on and the structure and coherence of it.

I also got to see Amadeus close up and find it powerful and well thought out of with some unique and telling features. I wish him all the best for it. A few months later, we built the site for my student's center. These are now available in the AmadeusWeb.com showcase.

## His Evolution

I have seen him through his creative and productive times and also through his lows - but even in a soul sapping low, there is a resilience and determination that he brings.

Fast forward to 2025 when Amadeus v6 is ready with it's people to "work with", I can say I'm pleased to still be a part of his journey and wish him the very best.

## Our Future

We are currently discussing the creating of a community website for those youth who we engage through my first book, which he helped outline and edit, and the books I would write in the future.
