When I first met Imran more than a year ago, I was going through a spiritual emergence process and with that I could clearly see the purity and innovativeness of Imran's creative energies. 

We immediately connected and he wrote a beautiful poem about my life just based on a few things I told him.  We then embarked on creating a website for a peer support group for people with mental illness undergoing spiritual process like the one I was. This was the most exciting and well guided process of my life.

I'm a trained allopathic physician and researcher with years of training in recognizing people with great creative potential. Well Imran is certainly one of those persons with the rare added quality of wanting to make an expansive social change in many spheres such as education, elderly wellbeing, mental health etc.

He's a passionate advocate for "all things bright and beautiful" to put it in his own words. His energy is infectious and gets teams motivated. 

He is an expert in his area of web design and works with a unique web builder of his own devising called AmadeusWeb. 

He's certainly an asset to the software community and society as a whole! I wish him the best as he continues to try and impact the society with his innovativeÂ ideas.
