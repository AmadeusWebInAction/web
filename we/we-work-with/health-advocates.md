** Website in focus is [Vishwas](https://amadeuweb.world/vishwas/)**

* Worked on Vishwas as an "independant git reposity" (node) within a section (members) of a larger (YM) site - so content stays owned by them.
* Wrote some "code" whereby [the resources](https://amadeuweb.world/vishwas/resources/) are developed from a sheet.
* Prototyped a wiki section, whereby a whole menu section with content can be driven by an "wiki" sheet.
* Geared up to build websites for medical practitioners and hospitals.
* Can help appraise "Hospital Management Systems" and drive customizations to vendor.
* A newsletter can be developed both online and by email. Suggested is [groups.io](https://groups.io/).
