** Website in focus is [WiseOwls](https://wiseowls.life/)** - all about the legacy of Loved Ones

* Caring for & Sharing of life's experiences / lessons learnt.
* Leave behind memorabilia, photo albums, video messages and stories.
* Multiple [family trees](https://wiseowls.life/sivaramans/family-tree/) can be built into a single web page for large families. [Another format](https://cselian.com/pocs/family/) exists for this.
* Find comfort in reliving past memories and releasing pains.
* Post reflection / release, we hope you will decide to find purpose again where your interests intersect with the larger global community.
* No topic is taboo and we want to genuinely help prepare for a "graceful ending" per your own faiths and beliefs. Not afraid / alone like so many loved ones we know who have passed on.
