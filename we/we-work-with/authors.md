* Work -has-> Collection -has-> Piece file based system which lets you define date, dedication, category and description etc.
* Navigable through all of these. Shows description and lets you choose which poems / essays to show.
* Shows images for each post.
* A lightweight alternative also available which uses the "composite work" concept where numbered pieces and categories (with images) are defined in a single file (seen on the menu).
* Allows for printing (A5) with covers, links in PDF to online versions and sorting of the poems. Can be enhanced to category section covers as well. Continuation markerks have been developed so that in the PRINT version, text doesnt overflow into the footer.
