## Why not Wordpress

Wordpress was good for me, Imran since 2007 when I was introduced to it. For more than a decade it was my "Golden Hammer". But I have been building file based players and viewers and sites since 2000, so in 2019 when one of my wordpress sites got hacked, I decided to go all out and build something with "fresh perspective" solving many of the development and authoring hurdles I have seen building both simple and entgerprise websites.
